# Prompt Engineering Process

### Attempt 1
#### Intention
>What is the improvement that you intend to make?

    This was the first attempt, which had a temperature of 2 and max tokens of 100. The system prompt tells the model that
    it has human-like emotions and to express them somehow. Also, I simply told it that it is a Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master, with no additional detail. I had the conversation initialize with a simple Hello message to the model.

### Attempt 2
#### Intention
>What is the improvement that you intend to make?

#### Action/Change
>Why do you think this action/change will improve the agent?

#### Result
>What was the result?

#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>Why do you think it did or did not work?
